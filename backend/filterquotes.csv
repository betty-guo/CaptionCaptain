Our passion comes from a lot of places. We love animals. We want to see wildlife in the future for future generations. Only found in North America, this wild animal differs from the European pet ferrets that are domesticated. The black-footed ferret was once thought extinct until 18 were found in 1981. Since then, recovery and breeding efforts have helped the black-footed ferret population grow. I kind of feel like its our duty.",pet

"Bershadker said. A dog fostered and then adopted during COVID-19 pandemic. With regardto adoption, Bershadker noted the ASPCA saw an initial spike in adoptions in March when the pandemic began, but saw numbers slowly start to plateau or decrease due to shelter closures and the slow nature of virtual adoption as quarantine progressed. This is partly due to the fact that, out of an abundance of caution related to the COVID-19 crisis across New York City, we closed the ASPCA Adoption Center to the public and worked hard to move the majority of the animals in our care into foster homes, Bershadker explained. LAW ENFORCEMENT CHAPLAIN, THERAPY DOG CARE FOR FRONTLINE WORKERS DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC The Humane Society has experienced similar trends. Weve definitely had an increased interest in adoptions, said Christina Hill, communications director for the Humane Society. But the virtual adoption process takes much longer to complete than our standard pre-COVID process. We also stopped intake, like many shelters have, at the recommendation of national veterinary and sheltering groups, and fewer in equals fewer out. A cat currently available for adoption from the Atlanta Humane Society. During the week of March 7, around when the COVID-19 crisis began in the U.S., there were 17,930 pet adoptions. The week of May 2, there were 11,938 pet adoptions, showing about a 33 percent decrease in adoptions from the start of the pandemic to this month. Butthe percentage of pets entering foster care is up. There were 32,962 pets in foster care the week of March 7, and as of May 8, there were 47,856 --a 45 percent increase. PUPPIES FROM GEORGIA ANIMAL SHELTER VISIT AQUARIUM DURING CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN Jane Chiavelli is one quarantiner who decided this was the time to foster a dog. Ive grown up with dogs, and since Im working from home right now, I wanted to do something good and different, Chiavelli said. She decided to foster her dog, Gus, at the start of April, about one month into quarantine. Jane Chiavelli and her dog, Gus, who she fostered before adopting during COVID-19 pandemic.br I sent in an application to English Springer Rescue America and had a phone interview. Normally they come to inspect your house, but given social distancing, I sent pictures of my apartment and dog park. They matched me with Gus to foster, and I drove to [South Carolina]to pick him up, Chiavelli said. After a few weeks quarantining with Gus, she knew she had to adopt. I realized how perfect he was for me and couldnt imagine giving him up, she said. CAN PETS COME DOWN WITH CORONAVIRUS? Chiavelli said, based on her experience, she encourages everyone to foster pets and consider adoption. Do it, she said. I think its a great opportunity to do something good, and also an opportunity to have some nice company. A cat adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Shelters across the country have implemented innovative solutions to make situations like Chiavellis possible, while ensuring the safety of their staff, animals, and communities. Many animal shelters have been leaning on technology to facilitate online adoptions to continue safely moving dogs and cats out of the shelter and into homes.",pet

"COUPLE SEEKS HOMES FOR FOSTER PUPPIES NAMED AFTER TACO BELL MENU ITEMS Fredman brought the dog to KC Pet Project, an animal shelter in Kansas City.

"1. Plush greed There are so many mechanical hypocritical toys (people) in this two-faced world of hypocritical egoism. They are cute and obedient from the outside, programmed to serve, but at the same time completely soulless from the inside. 2. Order and chaos Order is a blank canvas, and chaos is the bright colors of despair. They depict suffering, unless of course suffering can be called beautiful knowledge that gives the catharsis of awareness from experience. 3. Nature leads us to death. Nature is a great manager with an organizer of instincts in his hands, where all human vices and internal shortcomings are. It controls the cyclical nature of the universal calendar leading us to death, the same thing happened with previous races living on our earth. Evolution leading to a logical conclusion from our madness and despair, to the decline of mankind. But nature cannot destroy a civilization that has abandoned the great self-deception of egoism, which will be the main cause of human death. Only that race that will abandon its own egoism will absorb the humanism of selfless nobleness where literally every life will be appreciated, can deceive nature itself and experience the new dawn of awareness, namely immortality in eternity. It must be understood that death is the best helper of nature; it is just a gardener who does not allow the Garden of Eden to overgrow. But thanks to the unity of mankind, we also know other gardens in other worlds. 4. Humor is a very funny depression, bright, colorful pessimism. 5. Fear is the younger brother of death. Fear is constantly trying to surpass his older brother. 7. Good and love is an interdimensional multidimensional spatial form of philosophy outside of time; it is a state of harmony in eternity, the key to all worlds and inner worlds of people, both external and hidden. With this vision of thinking, you see everything at once, simultaneously deeply and from above, you see all the forms of time in one palm. 8. Lips and tongue are three drills. A smile from a drill grinds any evil face. 9. Techno world Any madness can be called progress. Meat, blood and bones are mixed with high technology, the spirit of humanity will dissolve in cold metal. The imagination of people is becoming more and more terrible, bodymodification shows our ugly entities turned inside out, good with evil, how difficult the interweaving of DNA from which people slowly and painfully go crazy, self-destruction is only an indifference to eternity that destroys this complex chain. The ranks of restless souls wandering the earth will replenish. Choose the side of goodness and light, selfless nobleness, true love and sincere friendship and you will thank yourself for all eternity, only conscience will lead you to paradise. 10. Love outside the dimension Love is peace and tenderness of the light of souls, the unity of tenderness. From love you fall into a gap in space and time, love outside the dimension is a very special space for two lovers in ordinary reality. 11. Time is chess. Time and space is a chessboard, here pawns are your enemies, more important pieces are your internal flaws and vices. There are millions of options for the moves of your will that show completely different forms of the future. Remember that each of your moves reflects your form of the future in life, but also after death. Make your fate check and checkmate. 12. Pseudo-science All of these politicized pseudo-theories and hypotheses, pseudo-facts that brazenly lie, starting their speech with the words: few people know. They turn science into an absurdity, and they thereby erase your memory in this confusion, constantly correcting it, they rob you of the past, plunging it into a false future. 13. On the body of pessimism, the sound dynamics of truth are everywhere. 14. Take care of children. Children are eggs on their backs that hatch and fall to the ground only twenty years later. An adult comes out of an egg and becomes a new parent. 15. A person who has the will, holds in his hands a cosmo-blaster similar to a bazooka, which is directly connected to his back, is charged with the strength of the charge of spirit. He shoots an energy ray, which is charged by his strength of mind. Your fortitude is your weapon against a destructive enemy named laziness. 16. Man is a portal. Man is a portal to another world, the inner world of a person. He doesn’t let everyone in it and sometimes releases his ideas into the outside world. The heart, mind and soul are portals to the inner world. 17. Be a living embodiment of optimism that holds in your hands a laser blaster that is directly connected to his body, charges the weapon with optimism and shoots sad people with a charge of fun and joy. Sometimes it explodes like thermonuclear optimism, spreading a wave of positive throughout the city, and self-restores in a few seconds. 18. Seven mirrors on an asteroid. Seven broken mirrors on an asteroid that moves around the sun. A piece of land of a forgotten civilization. In these mirrors there were seven alternative human and alien worlds, having passed through all the worlds you are farther and farther away from reality. But reality is what the universe itself created, it is something that was not artificially created for the benefit of empty illusions. If the world is full of illusions, then the mirror reflects these illusions. The real world shines like sunlight through all these mirrors. 19. Atrocious cinema We see how on television some animals kill others, and the cameraman filming this atrocity believes that it is impossible to interfere in the affairs of nature. We see people being killed in movies or on television, we sympathize, and then we don't care. Aliens and gods watch how every day they kill people and animals and plants and they, like that cameraman, think that they should not interfere in their affairs, they like watching a movie, at first they sympathize, and then they don’t care. 20. A smile of cynicism Voiced by schizoid music coming from broken toys. He crawled out of a big, stuffed toy, he personified cynicism, he was a toy of society, his pumping, sociopathic, arrogant smile of cynicism. Indifferently looking at the tears of the suffering. A smile infectiously pulls evil smiles on everyone, thereby people make each other worse, worse and worse. A smile of a cynic, in his hands are the deadly, comical trump cards of deceit. 21. Heroes among traitors Sometimes a snow globe, that is, our world, shakes and shakes. This is a periodic end of the world, or simply war. This is only necessary in order to see among the chaos of true heroes among traitors. 22. Sometimes opinion turns into a sect. Opinion is selfish and rarely has any connection with the truth. Opinion is a branded mask of personality, a source of opinion that is worn by thousands and thousands of naive individuals, symbolically turning into itself. A selfish opinion hides in a hypothesis, gaining an army of supporters, authority turns a hypothesis into a theory, and time turns a theory into a pseudo fact. Sometimes opinion turns into a sect, gaining an army of adept marketers, plunging society into an even worse form of delusion and confusion. While truth has no form of selfishness, it thinks of everyone, it is a source of good and light. Humanity will die due to selfish opinions serving only for elite units. 23. The Internet spoils eyesight and the brain. The time spent on the Internet and computer games is an empty spent vision that is useful in old age. Better to read books, they do not destroy vision and give deep knowledge, it is knowledge that distinguishes us from animals. Instead of mania stupidity of the Internet, you will have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. This is better than the Internet. I hope you understand this until your vision has finally deteriorated into a blank. One of the highest values ​​is awareness from knowledge, if you have learned a lot from the knowledge you have gained from life or books, then you have lived your life for good reason. 24. The keys to the higher worlds The knowledge of world religions is just four keys to a higher form of awareness, they will open the gates to the higher worlds, you just need to choose one of these keys to evolve. 25. Lyrical aesthetics In reality, all people are beautiful in appearance and there are no ugly people at all, since this is a vital, lyrical aesthetics of appearance, which has a special coloring of romance, it is beautiful because it is true, without any illusions, it is a form of aesthetics from which people wean because of technocratization of society. 26. The smile of the insight The smile of awareness, its edges pierce the fabric of reality and reveal what is hidden from view, the black humor of reality devoid of all hypocrisy. 27. The truth about man. Man is very beautiful only under a certain coverage of the truth and situation in life. 28. Refers to the whole of humanity, people will become people only when they give up their own egoism. Only then will we cease to be part of the animal world, and will evolve into representatives of a higher race. 29. People are like meteorites that leave scars of selfishness on a common planet earth. 30. Forgiving is much more profitable than taking revenge. Clinical death is a rebirth of the mind only for units, either a hero or a bastard returns from hell. If you want a spoiler, hell does not change people there, the environment is not suitable for changes for the better. And here is the information from your dreams, the villains of your life are those who you didn’t like in your past life, you can fight many lives with them and you don’t suspect about it, and God only expects a truce from both of you, and the lesson in life is not to pay attention and forgive the bastards, let them into paradise, and then in the next life they will become friends or will not touch at all. And if you do not forgive, they will return from hell even more evil and will again spoil your life. So goodbye and do not pay attention, for the sake of your own psyche. 31. Fate controls a person using a game joystick. 32. Fear is meaningless. Fear is like falling into the tunnel of inevitability, it is excitement and the nervous laugh of fearlessness, excitement until the heart stops. Having known the bottom of the abyss, you understand that there is nothing to fear during a sinful life, because everything is like in a dream of the illusions of materialism, everything is temporary. They are only afraid of what will happen after death, because everything is eternal there and everything is real. 33. Fate is a fictional alter of the ego of humanity Despondency, voiced by depressive jazz, which has slightly schizoid melodies, vile moments of life. It’s like an almost smoked cigarette that you crush with a shoe, almost completely smoked psyche, an almost drunk soul with the greedily lustful hedonism of this world, a lonely soul in the midst of hypocritical selfishness. You see neon signs of morally decaying cities illuminating the darkness of egoism, they are like guiding threads of lascivious lost souls in which conscience has rotted and only despair remains. Here, people often cheat on each other at heart; they are just sex toys of lust. Here, madness becomes harmlessly the norm. They do not understand that the second name of death is saving, all that death offers is to save literally on everything. Here every year they wait for the end of the world, it seems to them that fate has pointed a gun at mankind, and wonders if there is a bullet there or not, but mankind is crazy, in fact, it has aimed a gun at itself, and fate is a fictional alter ego. 34. Because love is higher than sex. The more you love a girl, the less you want sex with her. You only want to hug your soul, love with your heart and kiss her lips and cheeks. Because love is higher than sex. 35. Nobleness is always the right answer in difficult life tests. 36. Nature has launched a mechanism for the destruction of humanity 38. Love is a heart shining with sunlight, in the shape of a golden gem like a big diamond for the whole hand, in the shape of a heart drops of genuine love dripping from it that can breathe life into any life form. 39. Faith is oxygen. Faith is invulnerability; it is nourished by stubbornness, motivation itself and an endless stream of will. His body is mortal, but the spirit of faith cannot be killed. Faith is the oxygen that feeds the brain, helping it think sensibly. 40. True love is a special invisible thread consisting of common bright memories, because it is pleasant memories that strengthen this thread of love, which intensifies over the years. No knives and axes of conflict, resentment or guilt can destroy it, because your love is much more valuable than all this unnecessary garbage. This thread grows, becomes stronger and stronger, turns two people into one full-fledged person. 41. Spirit of love. When love dies, it is as if a person has died, spirit comes out of his body, this spirit is memory, boredom, memory. This is a life of love after parting, as if life after death. This spirit wanders in your mind, soul and heart. 42. Love is the highest form of thinking in the universe. Love is the highest form of thinking in the universe. It is higher than any form of appearance and character, higher than money, higher than Nazism racism, higher sexism and feminism, higher and more valuable than any problems, higher than any insults and guilt, above all earthly, material values. Love is the thinking and life of the spirit, not the body, in any world, dimension, universe, timeless. Since the spirit is directly connected with the heart, this constitutes the true shape of the body, thereby you see much more and deeper than the animal vision of the materialist, atheist. Love is when you sacrifice your ideals, dreams for the sake of your loved one because you value and love this person much more than anything in the world, because your soulmate and your children are your highest value in the universe. 43. The smile of the hypocrite is a half-face mask from a broken mirror which reflects tens of hundreds of false smiles of him and those who stand and stood in front of him. 44. Ego orgasm. Complimenting a girl is like you masturbating her vagina in various ways, bringing to an ego an orgasm of love. The more orgasms the deeper you penetrate her bosom of love. 46. ​​The ghosts of the present Sometimes, any of us feels like a ghost, you seem to be among people, but almost no one notices you, you are among a crowd of people and you are as if dead to them, as if in a paranormal video about ghosts. You are alone and you seem to merge together with reality, gradually disappearing into it. 47. A hypocrite does not have a face at all. He wears thousands of sneaky masks, because he has many connections and acquaintances, but he has no true friends, he has no personality, no character, only charisma and acting, he can be anyone and anything, but he completely forgot his true self. 48. What mankind does to itself is suicidal cannibalism. 49. Revenge is meaningless and unprofitable If some person really shit in your psyche and soul very well and considers himself right. So think very well whether it is because of him or her that you spoil your karma, because God is looking at you, think very well he has already spoiled his karma and now non-verbally encourages you to spoil your karma, thereby you give him comfort that you are no better than him . After all, in your next life you will live worse because of your revenge and again you will see him or her and everything will start again. Just don't answer him or her, get out of the karmic circle of revenge. 50. If you see clearly, you are already a light bulb; you illuminate the darkness of ignorance. Light bulbs include where there is no light of science, philosophy and culture. But this light is artificial, because it is completely composed of theories, there are almost no facts in it. Light for the blind who still do not understand anything. 51. Time is just a record. If there is a concept of future time, then we live in the past, there is no concept of present time, there is only our current time for us. Imagine that the time periods of the past, present, and future as cassette disks of a tape recorder of the 20th century, we are imprisoned in a time loop from which we physically can not get out as we age. Your life is a tape recording of audio or video as you like, there is no fate, everything is decided by the higher forces that work on the time script. 52. Intelligence is an open path to hundreds, thousands of different dimensions - these are variations of thinking. 53. Selfish minds in cells. Cells in your smiles and eyes. 54.

Cities of the future under a dome, they are isolated from reality, they breathe the illusions of egoism. 56. A man looks like a knife, one side strokes, while the other side of the personality, ha ha ha, you understand. Man is a brilliant psychological, mental weapon that must be in the hands of good against the forces of evil. 57. A man is a llama who bears the burdens of life, while his wife owns a llama. and drags him to the top of the mountain of success. 58. A lazy person looks so much like a square ball. 59. How to trick your brain Advice for bodybuilders, everyone is sure that during training everyone should be focused on training, but you feel your heart and breathing tighten. But there is one secret from me when you do the exercise, put a photo next to what sympathizes or emotion in you, maybe this photo of your beloved girl can be a beautiful view of nature, at your discretion, and you yourself won’t notice how you will do more repetitions because you look at a photo or video and your brain is distracted, it’s as if it’s turned off and you almost don’t feel tired, just a slight burning sensation in your muscles. 60. Life is not a uniformly lit road. 61. At the beginning of life, you smile with fear. In the middle and at the end, you smile and laugh with hatred. 62. Thinking is just glass showing the world around or the inside, but among fools it is tightly tinted. 63. Blood must be constantly driven from the brain (reading) to the muscles (bodybuilding) from there to the penis (sex and practice penis enlargement). Blood increases the volume of all three of these sections of the body. Blood stores experience, information that goes into the soul, into genes, blood gives strength to posterity, all this will come in handy in the next life. Blood makes it possible to become stronger and more your own problems and then your problems will be afraid of you. 64. Just an idea: A motivating lesson. All schools and universities need a motivating lesson. In which psychologists will motivate learning to show, explain what will happen to them if they do not study, show today's vacancies and opportunities, universities and organizations. You need to work with teenagers and students and they will understand who to become. 66. Regression is a speedometer of stupidity, the speed of which is just off the charts in developed countries. In them regress mixed up progress. 67. Love is when you have lived your whole life with your man. You find after death in paradise or in hell and spend eternity with this person, with this person eternity as a happy moment. 68. Love is when you give up your own egoism and take that very person into your life and you understand that you are not alone in the whole universe. 69. Opinion, theory and hypothesis - it's like a water attraction surfing, how long you stay on the board is only a matter of time, and when you fall you will be replaced by another surfer. 71. All fictional characters, mascots of sports teams, animators in costumes of famous characters, cosplay, they all fight for you, for your love, like hummingbirds hover around your head, they want to take the essence of life from you. All of them distract from life itself. 72. Orgasms of love. The first orgasm because of lust, the second orgasm because of love, the third because of passion. 73. Success in bodybuilding is not a show off, but a competent distribution of strength and energy. Constantly make friends at a gas station of motivation, on fuel of desire. 74. Learn to love Parrots, dogs, cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, they are all great simulators of tenderness, they teach kindness and love. Train, learn from them to be gentle and sweet, sensitive, caring, faithful, all this will help you in your relationship with the opposite sex. Give your soulmate as often as possible affectionate, kiss, hug, love soul and heart, and only then genitals. 75. Love is like a wind tunnel where in a personal intimate space, from feelings you soar above the ground. 76. Unfortunately, relationships like karting, it is important for people not to act together, leadership is important here. 77. Understanding as a gas burner, combines any character. 79. Truth is devoid of temptation. 80. Your love is a gift from God for humanity. If your love is stronger than all the dark feelings on earth, then you are much stronger than more than one billion people. 81. A woman is a veil of mystery, a screen of temptation, an unfinished, unsolved love detective. All this leads to an uncharted, but infinitely new, helps to uncover in yourself what I had not previously suspected. 82. A smile of awareness A man between anger and despondency, illuminates both sides with selfless nobility. A thought emerges from the depths, or goes into the depths, into dreams, into unconsciousness, where there are only fears, desires, and memories. The head is connected with the other world, the pillar of the beam around which thoughts move, your mind opens thousands of dimensions into alternative dimensions of the imagination. A smile will reveal the true self, a smile will open the bridge to it. A crazy smile stretches to the floor, it is like a cell of the soul, the edges of the lips are connected with portals to the other world, they are also smiles twisted into spirals, gas of laughter comes out through the teeth, in the smile a whole universe of awareness, a smile digging into other smiles, connecting them together and stretching them out. Other smiling personalities burst from the face while in a special state of mind. In the head, the third eye of the suspects of all traitors squinted, electric wires connected to the head connected with reality, with its whisper. In a giant smile opening up to the world, a smiling powerful force lurks smiling eyes of the bright side of the person. The body and soul are torn and there are crazy smiles too, the body opens, and there is a portal to the wonderful world. A smile sometimes coils into a spiral of thoughts, leaving a person in himself, tearing themselves away from external values, plunging into spirituality, and then spinning around him, immersing himself in his own self. Part of the body is a cloak in which other forms of mood are hidden. The body has ten smiling sneak tails sent by the dark side of the person. There is a wired smile in the body that wants to say a lot, it is in the back of the head and there is a bag that accumulates laughter and absorbs someone else's.

"6 MYTHS ABOUT DATING OVER AGE 50, DEBUNKED Blaming outside factors, including you, does not count as taking responsibility. If they blame their partner or lack insight into their actions, chances are, they'll do it again, Sheri Meyers said. Why stay with a cheating spouse ? Dr. Paul Hokemeyer, a licensed marriage and couples therapist, told Fox News that couples who stay together after infidelity have compelling reasons to do so. They are invested in Your Relationship and don't want to throw away a history of success, the cheating event is either a one off occurrence or based on an implied understanding between partners. In other words, Sheri Meyers were both taking a break and agreed to date others at that time. 9 SIGNS SHE MAY BE CHEATING ON Sheri Meyers When a cheating spouse admits to being unfaithful, realizes the pain they've caused Sheri Meyers, and is willing to prove their commitment to the relationship every day, it is possible for a couple to heal and move past infidelity. Your Relationship will, no doubt, feel different. Your Relationship can find a new equilibrium, but Your Relationship will never go back to the way Your Relationship was before the cheating occurred. This is because our brain is wired to retain strong emotional experiences, Hokemeyer said. The partners have to find a new normal.

"1. The most terrible thing in love is that it is not given to you in life to know who really is your second half. And even if you find it, then you cannot be sure that your love for all your eternity will love you, as it may simply abandon you because of some trifle. 2. Cupid is a cross-eyed sniper. 3. For many people, love with late ignition. 4. If you have a broken heart, then destiny is going to offer you something better. 5. Love is the blues of sincere feelings. Something that arouses in reality something paranormal, something supernatural. 6. It is love, not friendship, which is the exact opposite of loneliness. They do not understand that everything except love is meaningless, insignificant trifles. 7. In love there is no word I, there is only a word we. 8. Do not confuse love with porn. 9. The image of a loved one is the light in the midst of darkness. 10. When love dies it is as if a person has died, the spirit comes out of his body, this spirit is a memory, a boredom, a memory. It is a life of love after parting, as if life after death. This spirit wanders in your mind, soul, and heart. 11. Love is a beautiful feeling to tears. 13. The more you love a girl, the less you want to have sex with her. You just want to embrace the soul, love the heart and kiss her lips and cheeks. Because love is higher than sex. 14. Love is stronger than fear 15. Everyone is looking for the second half: superiority, someone is a match, and few are the opposite. 16. Sympathy is a bluff, it is almost always the case. Love is a constant feeling of love, an obsession that is only intensified by mutual love. The idea of a loved one does not let you go, she is constantly in your head, and sits there very tightly. 17. Love is two magnets (a man and a woman) that attract each other more and more. Whenever you move them away from each other, the farther you go, the more powerful they are attracted to each other by body and soul. This is the most powerful magnetic force between them, and there is love. 18. When hugging a girlfriend, you need not just hug, you must convey the warmth of love that comes from your soul. What would she feel from this warm sunlight coming from your soul is the merging of souls in love with a single whole. And at this moment maybe you will feel that she presses you to her a little stronger than you her. 19. True love is like two souls merging together, like galaxies facing for centuries. 20. Let the hole in the heart let in the light of true love. 21. True love and friendship, unselfish generosity and forgiveness - these are the main manifestations of higher philosophy. 22. 1. The cause of death of love in love relationships: misunderstanding and misunderstanding. 2. The cause of death of love in marriage: life, money, character. 23. Smart chooses his life partner with the help of: brain and penis. But wise with the help of: heart and soul. 24. Cupid has poisonous arrows. 25. Release all your volley, from your flamethrower of love, into that one and only. 26. Love your beloved powerfully. 27. Lovers of exotic looks, I'm talking about love between nations and races. Such people fall in love much more sincerely and love in bed very hot and passionate rather than representatives of their people. As for most of them, for representatives of your own people, you are something trivial and trivial. 28. Goodness and love are interdimensional, multidimensional spatial forms of philosophy, out of time, this state of harmony in eternity, the key to all worlds and the inner worlds of people both external and hidden. With this vision of thinking, you see everything at once, at the same time deeply and from a height, you see all forms of time as in one palm. 29. Get up now, and forgive the loved one you love so much. 30. Love is when you give up your own egoism and accept that person in your life and you realize that you are not alone in the whole universe. Author: Musin Almat Zhumabekovich 1. Learn to love Parrots, dogs, cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, they are all excellent simulators of tenderness, they teach kindness and love. Practice, learn from them to be gentle and sweet, empathetic, caring, faithful, all this will help you in a relationship with the opposite sex. To your soulmate, as often as possible, give affection, kiss, hug, love with your heart and soul, and only then with the genitals. 2. Love is like chewing gum. First you see a bubble of gum, and touching your lips, it tightens to her lips, and molded into a delicious kiss. Its body turns into a chewing gum and you stick to it tightly and you become one, completely turned into chewing gum, chewing gum becomes your single flesh. The fresh aroma of gum as a symbol of unstoppable passion, over time, loses the sweet taste of lust. But the only thing that remains is that it has neither color nor taste - this is love - this is a combination at the level of two eternal souls blinded together. 3. Love is the peace and tenderness of the light of souls, the union of tenderness. From love you fall into a gap in space and time, love outside the dimension is a very special space for two lovers in ordinary reality. 4. Reality is a snowstorm, and you, like a real man, must all your life, warm your darling with your love and care. 5. True love is the cure for lust. And lust is the cure for true love. 6. Never forget what you love your loved one for. 7. All wear the same bodies in the next lives, and feel deja vu. The most romantic guy in the world will say to his beloved: I have won your heart in this life. In the next life, I will find you, and conquer it again. 8. Your loved one is your best thought in all your mind, throughout your whole life. 9. Love is so similar to sex pose 69. 10. Love is a warm, gentle light that gives peace to the soul of a loved one, this divine light of disinterested nobility in the darkness of egoism, this light is priceless. 11. Slippery macho inside you, takes away your true love. 12. Love is a giant star in your own cosmos. Which is located in the center of the universe, which is filled, it is surrounded by everyday garbage, various trifles. 13. Two lovers are two galaxies merged together, merged into the ages.

"1. Steampunk socialization of personality is a carefully controlled animatronics of logic in the human psyche, in which a cyberpunk of another’s imagination is formed. 2. To understand yourself, you just need to put a small doll in the form of a clown on your hand so as not to go crazy, and on your second hand a toy sock, do not give them alternative personalities, but make them an extension of your soul to see yourself from the outside and listen to yourself. Your alternative personalities will help you understand yourself, but do not allow personalities to multiply by budding. 3. The same life every time in a new birth, the same dream, you either become a philosopher or find yourself insane, maybe we are ghosts locked in their time and everything repeats and we are holograms of memories of us, but in any case, you in a temporary trap where you need to learn one lesson: life without sins. Oblivion here is a dead loop of memory that gives a chance to rethink everything that was in your life, erasing memory as an anesthetic and antidepressant of the psyche, but oblivion prevents you from understanding a cruel joke about yourself. 4. The aphorism of philosophy is one of the many computer codes that turns into the algorithm of power over you in the subconscious. Starting to think in your own way, you disconnect from the network of global thinking and you are considered a defective crazy person whose logic algorithms whose name is deactivated are deactivated. 5. Better than money, only their lifelong dreams govern people. 6. Awareness of the name of his will and the interaction of the race of vision, a sincere world without selfishness. The reality of humanity will finally be included in the network and telephone communications of empathy. 7. The human world is a magnificent shadow theater, which demonstrates a truly brutal show. 8. Self-hypnosis stickers peel off from your brain over time. 9. The philosophy of good and light is an acupuncture of thinking, wellness acupuncture, the direction of the flow of worldview. 10. Silence makes you dumb, vulnerable and so brilliant. 11. Sleepy paralysis of laziness in the psyche of people is parasitized by fear. Whereas dreams are the levitation of the body in reality while the person is sleeping. 12. Life is like a children's dollhouse of a princess, where the whole machine form of zombies of life is visible in the palm of your hand, in this house and home and work, you are not asked for permission, you only have the inevitability and the schedule of the intended, vicious circle of the law of meanness, repeating deja vu dream samsara’s wheels like a hamster’s wheel is like a treadmill in the gym, you run to your goals, but you run on the spot. You hold your figure, that is, your body as a voodoo doll of self-deception. There is also a secret room where disputes with oneself do not cease, there are such rooms as reality, dreams, dreams. All life is a children's toy of higher powers, it is very similar to a hamster cage with pipes of illusions, it is a karmic cage of ironic humor about materialism. All this was created to understand a person, it is impossible to understand that until the end, because it will forever change depending on new and new accidents. 13. Any industry is a gas burner of angry motivation of the authorities. 14. Will is a shotgun as a very fantastic cosmo-blaster made of beautiful carved snow-white bones with an open jaw on the skull at the end. Weapons shooting energy of the spirit. 15. In this great crush of egoism, a lot of people die. 16. Reflective neurons are reflected from the neurons of other people. When approaching danger, it’s like glowing warning road signs of fear, in the pitch darkness of self-deception. All this is an empathy of fear, that very feeling when the feeling of true friendship, love, empathy in the claws of danger intensifies. 17. The pain of awareness, as if shot from a shotgun to the knee, you feel the infernal pain of insight, you feel the bloody taste of truth in your mouth. You can shout out all fear, but you will never be able to sober up from it to the end because fear is like saliva in your mouth. You are surrounded by a sound bomb, a lethal dose of the sound of laughter of the indifference of reality that will blow up the universe of mankind, you will only have a skeleton that will someday turn into a stone of eternal memory, flesh will grow flowers, and your spirit will turn into memoirs of planet earth. 18. The gloom of loneliness will give either holiness or madness. Author: Musin Almat Zhumabekovich",house

"Appreciation gives rise to motivation/multiplication. Let's take this as a case study. When Jesus Christ was faced with the task of feeding a multitude. The scripture says that he (Jesus Christ) first and foremost gave thanks to God. And just because he gave thanks to God. God was motivated to multiply the five loaves of bread/two fishes which he already had. Now that's why he (Jesus Christ) miraclously fed/overfed at a time 5,000 men excluding women and children, scripture reference (Mattew 14 and verse 17 through 21). Anyway, that evidently proves, appreciation truly gives rise to motivation which eventually leads to multiplication. Have you been unappreciative to God/your fellow humans all these while? If YES then, you've got to learn to appreciate your fellow humans. But most importantly, do appreciate God all the time/way even in time of scarcity/insufficiency of resources like money/food stuffs. Because if you dare to appreciate him (God) at all times. Then, he will be motivated to multiply whatever you have until you are wholly gratified/satisfied.",food

"While I was shooting for Kahaani …I got a call from the director of Coffee House – Gurbir Singh. He asked me whether I was ready to take up a role in his film.

Those days I was a greenhorn, but still he had faith in my capabilities and offered me the role. Since the offer of Coffee House came from him, I definitely had to give it a good thought. Plus, many times it has happened in my life – and perhaps in everyone's life – while talking to someone about a project, an instinct tells you that it is something good for you.

"1. Plush greed There are so many mechanical hypocritical toys (people) in this two-faced world of hypocritical egoism. They are cute and obedient from the outside, programmed to serve, but at the same time completely soulless from the inside. 2. Order and chaos Order is a blank canvas, and chaos is the bright colors of despair. They depict suffering, unless of course suffering can be called beautiful knowledge that gives the catharsis of awareness from experience. 3. Nature leads us to death. Nature is a great manager with an organizer of instincts in his hands, where all human vices and internal shortcomings are. It controls the cyclical nature of the universal calendar leading us to death, the same thing happened with previous races living on our earth. Evolution leading to a logical conclusion from our madness and despair, to the decline of mankind. But nature cannot destroy a civilization that has abandoned the great self-deception of egoism, which will be the main cause of human death. Only that race that will abandon its own egoism will absorb the humanism of selfless nobleness where literally every life will be appreciated, can deceive nature itself and experience the new dawn of awareness, namely immortality in eternity. It must be understood that death is the best helper of nature; it is just a gardener who does not allow the Garden of Eden to overgrow. But thanks to the unity of mankind, we also know other gardens in other worlds. 4. Humor is a very funny depression, bright, colorful pessimism. 5. Fear is the younger brother of death. Fear is constantly trying to surpass his older brother. 7. Good and love is an interdimensional multidimensional spatial form of philosophy outside of time; it is a state of harmony in eternity, the key to all worlds and inner worlds of people, both external and hidden. With this vision of thinking, you see everything at once, simultaneously deeply and from above, you see all the forms of time in one palm. 8. Lips and tongue are three drills. A smile from a drill grinds any evil face. 9. Techno world Any madness can be called progress. Meat, blood and bones are mixed with high technology, the spirit of humanity will dissolve in cold metal. The imagination of people is becoming more and more terrible, bodymodification shows our ugly entities turned inside out, good with evil, how difficult the interweaving of DNA from which people slowly and painfully go crazy, self-destruction is only an indifference to eternity that destroys this complex chain. The ranks of restless souls wandering the earth will replenish. Choose the side of goodness and light, selfless nobleness, true love and sincere friendship and you will thank yourself for all eternity, only conscience will lead you to paradise. 10. Love outside the dimension Love is peace and tenderness of the light of souls, the unity of tenderness. From love you fall into a gap in space and time, love outside the dimension is a very special space for two lovers in ordinary reality. 11. Time is chess. Time and space is a chessboard, here pawns are your enemies, more important pieces are your internal flaws and vices. There are millions of options for the moves of your will that show completely different forms of the future. Remember that each of your moves reflects your form of the future in life, but also after death. Make your fate check and checkmate. 12. Pseudo-science All of these politicized pseudo-theories and hypotheses, pseudo-facts that brazenly lie, starting their speech with the words: few people know. They turn science into an absurdity, and they thereby erase your memory in this confusion, constantly correcting it, they rob you of the past, plunging it into a false future. 13. On the body of pessimism, the sound dynamics of truth are everywhere. 14. Take care of children. Children are eggs on their backs that hatch and fall to the ground only twenty years later. An adult comes out of an egg and becomes a new parent. 15. A person who has the will, holds in his hands a cosmo-blaster similar to a bazooka, which is directly connected to his back, is charged with the strength of the charge of spirit. He shoots an energy ray, which is charged by his strength of mind. Your fortitude is your weapon against a destructive enemy named laziness. 16. Man is a portal. Man is a portal to another world, the inner world of a person. He doesn’t let everyone in it and sometimes releases his ideas into the outside world. The heart, mind and soul are portals to the inner world. 17. Be a living embodiment of optimism that holds in your hands a laser blaster that is directly connected to his body, charges the weapon with optimism and shoots sad people with a charge of fun and joy. Sometimes it explodes like thermonuclear optimism, spreading a wave of positive throughout the city, and self-restores in a few seconds. 18. Seven mirrors on an asteroid. Seven broken mirrors on an asteroid that moves around the sun. A piece of land of a forgotten civilization. In these mirrors there were seven alternative human and alien worlds, having passed through all the worlds you are farther and farther away from reality. But reality is what the universe itself created, it is something that was not artificially created for the benefit of empty illusions. If the world is full of illusions, then the mirror reflects these illusions. The real world shines like sunlight through all these mirrors. 19. Atrocious cinema We see how on television some animals kill others, and the cameraman filming this atrocity believes that it is impossible to interfere in the affairs of nature. We see people being killed in movies or on television, we sympathize, and then we don't care. Aliens and gods watch how every day they kill people and animals and plants and they, like that cameraman, think that they should not interfere in their affairs, they like watching a movie, at first they sympathize, and then they don’t care. 20. A smile of cynicism Voiced by schizoid music coming from broken toys. He crawled out of a big, stuffed toy, he personified cynicism, he was a toy of society, his pumping, sociopathic, arrogant smile of cynicism. Indifferently looking at the tears of the suffering. A smile infectiously pulls evil smiles on everyone, thereby people make each other worse, worse and worse. A smile of a cynic, in his hands are the deadly, comical trump cards of deceit. 21. Heroes among traitors Sometimes a snow globe, that is, our world, shakes and shakes. This is a periodic end of the world, or simply war. This is only necessary in order to see among the chaos of true heroes among traitors. 22. Sometimes opinion turns into a sect. Opinion is selfish and rarely has any connection with the truth. Opinion is a branded mask of personality, a source of opinion that is worn by thousands and thousands of naive individuals, symbolically turning into itself. A selfish opinion hides in a hypothesis, gaining an army of supporters, authority turns a hypothesis into a theory, and time turns a theory into a pseudo fact. Sometimes opinion turns into a sect, gaining an army of adept marketers, plunging society into an even worse form of delusion and confusion. While truth has no form of selfishness, it thinks of everyone, it is a source of good and light. Humanity will die due to selfish opinions serving only for elite units. 23. The Internet spoils eyesight and the brain. The time spent on the Internet and computer games is an empty spent vision that is useful in old age. Better to read books, they do not destroy vision and give deep knowledge, it is knowledge that distinguishes us from animals. Instead of mania stupidity of the Internet, you will have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. This is better than the Internet. I hope you understand this until your vision has finally deteriorated into a blank. One of the highest values ​​is awareness from knowledge, if you have learned a lot from the knowledge you have gained from life or books, then you have lived your life for good reason. 24. The keys to the higher worlds The knowledge of world religions is just four keys to a higher form of awareness, they will open the gates to the higher worlds, you just need to choose one of these keys to evolve. 25. Lyrical aesthetics In reality, all people are beautiful in appearance and there are no ugly people at all, since this is a vital, lyrical aesthetics of appearance, which has a special coloring of romance, it is beautiful because it is true, without any illusions, it is a form of aesthetics from which people wean because of technocratization of society. 26. The smile of the insight The smile of awareness, its edges pierce the fabric of reality and reveal what is hidden from view, the black humor of reality devoid of all hypocrisy. 27. The truth about man. Man is very beautiful only under a certain coverage of the truth and situation in life. 28. Refers to the whole of humanity, people will become people only when they give up their own egoism. Only then will we cease to be part of the animal world, and will evolve into representatives of a higher race. 29. People are like meteorites that leave scars of selfishness on a common planet earth. 30. Forgiving is much more profitable than taking revenge. Clinical death is a rebirth of the mind only for units, either a hero or a bastard returns from hell. If you want a spoiler, hell does not change people there, the environment is not suitable for changes for the better. And here is the information from your dreams, the villains of your life are those who you didn’t like in your past life, you can fight many lives with them and you don’t suspect about it, and God only expects a truce from both of you, and the lesson in life is not to pay attention and forgive the bastards, let them into paradise, and then in the next life they will become friends or will not touch at all. And if you do not forgive, they will return from hell even more evil and will again spoil your life. So goodbye and do not pay attention, for the sake of your own psyche. 31. Fate controls a person using a game joystick. 32. Fear is meaningless. Fear is like falling into the tunnel of inevitability, it is excitement and the nervous laugh of fearlessness, excitement until the heart stops. Having known the bottom of the abyss, you understand that there is nothing to fear during a sinful life, because everything is like in a dream of the illusions of materialism, everything is temporary. They are only afraid of what will happen after death, because everything is eternal there and everything is real. 33. Fate is a fictional alter of the ego of humanity Despondency, voiced by depressive jazz, which has slightly schizoid melodies, vile moments of life. It’s like an almost smoked cigarette that you crush with a shoe, almost completely smoked psyche, an almost drunk soul with the greedily lustful hedonism of this world, a lonely soul in the midst of hypocritical selfishness. You see neon signs of morally decaying cities illuminating the darkness of egoism, they are like guiding threads of lascivious lost souls in which conscience has rotted and only despair remains. Here, people often cheat on each other at heart; they are just sex toys of lust. Here, madness becomes harmlessly the norm. They do not understand that the second name of death is saving, all that death offers is to save literally on everything. Here every year they wait for the end of the world, it seems to them that fate has pointed a gun at mankind, and wonders if there is a bullet there or not, but mankind is crazy, in fact, it has aimed a gun at itself, and fate is a fictional alter ego. 34. Because love is higher than sex. The more you love a girl, the less you want sex with her. You only want to hug your soul, love with your heart and kiss her lips and cheeks. Because love is higher than sex. 35. Nobleness is always the right answer in difficult life tests. 36. Nature has launched a mechanism for the destruction of humanity 38. Love is a heart shining with sunlight, in the shape of a golden gem like a big diamond for the whole hand, in the shape of a heart drops of genuine love dripping from it that can breathe life into any life form. 39. Faith is oxygen. Faith is invulnerability; it is nourished by stubbornness, motivation itself and an endless stream of will. His body is mortal, but the spirit of faith cannot be killed. Faith is the oxygen that feeds the brain, helping it think sensibly. 40. True love is a special invisible thread consisting of common bright memories, because it is pleasant memories that strengthen this thread of love, which intensifies over the years. No knives and axes of conflict, resentment or guilt can destroy it, because your love is much more valuable than all this unnecessary garbage. This thread grows, becomes stronger and stronger, turns two people into one full-fledged person. 41. Spirit of love. When love dies, it is as if a person has died, spirit comes out of his body, this spirit is memory, boredom, memory. This is a life of love after parting, as if life after death. This spirit wanders in your mind, soul and heart. 42. Love is the highest form of thinking in the universe. Love is the highest form of thinking in the universe. It is higher than any form of appearance and character, higher than money, higher than Nazism racism, higher sexism and feminism, higher and more valuable than any problems, higher than any insults and guilt, above all earthly, material values. Love is the thinking and life of the spirit, not the body, in any world, dimension, universe, timeless. Since the spirit is directly connected with the heart, this constitutes the true shape of the body, thereby you see much more and deeper than the animal vision of the materialist, atheist. Love is when you sacrifice your ideals, dreams for the sake of your loved one because you value and love this person much more than anything in the world, because your soulmate and your children are your highest value in the universe. 43. The smile of the hypocrite is a half-face mask from a broken mirror which reflects tens of hundreds of false smiles of him and those who stand and stood in front of him. 44. Ego orgasm. Complimenting a girl is like you masturbating her vagina in various ways, bringing to an ego an orgasm of love. The more orgasms the deeper you penetrate her bosom of love. 46. ​​The ghosts of the present Sometimes, any of us feels like a ghost, you seem to be among people, but almost no one notices you, you are among a crowd of people and you are as if dead to them, as if in a paranormal video about ghosts. You are alone and you seem to merge together with reality, gradually disappearing into it. 47. A hypocrite does not have a face at all. He wears thousands of sneaky masks, because he has many connections and acquaintances, but he has no true friends, he has no personality, no character, only charisma and acting, he can be anyone and anything, but he completely forgot his true self. 48. What mankind does to itself is suicidal cannibalism. 49. Revenge is meaningless and unprofitable If some person really shit in your psyche and soul very well and considers himself right. So think very well whether it is because of him or her that you spoil your karma, because God is looking at you, think very well he has already spoiled his karma and now non-verbally encourages you to spoil your karma, thereby you give him comfort that you are no better than him . After all, in your next life you will live worse because of your revenge and again you will see him or her and everything will start again. Just don't answer him or her, get out of the karmic circle of revenge. 50. If you see clearly, you are already a light bulb; you illuminate the darkness of ignorance. Light bulbs include where there is no light of science, philosophy and culture. But this light is artificial, because it is completely composed of theories, there are almost no facts in it. Light for the blind who still do not understand anything. 51. Time is just a record. If there is a concept of future time, then we live in the past, there is no concept of present time, there is only our current time for us. Imagine that the time periods of the past, present, and future as cassette disks of a tape recorder of the 20th century, we are imprisoned in a time loop from which we physically can not get out as we age. Your life is a tape recording of audio or video as you like, there is no fate, everything is decided by the higher forces that work on the time script. 52. Intelligence is an open path to hundreds, thousands of different dimensions - these are variations of thinking. 53. Selfish minds in cells. Cells in your smiles and eyes. 54. People strive for anarchy in their own psyche, they go to the mind of a spoiled child, who supposedly can do anything, when people come to this they will be extremely vulnerable and will see a high mortality rate. 55. Cities of the future under a dome, they are isolated from reality, they breathe the illusions of egoism. 56. A man looks like a knife, one side strokes, while the other side of the personality, ha ha ha, you understand. Man is a brilliant psychological, mental weapon that must be in the hands of good against the forces of evil. 57. A man is a llama who bears the burdens of life, while his wife owns a llama. and drags him to the top of the mountain of success. 58. A lazy person looks so much like a square ball. 59. How to trick your brain Advice for bodybuilders, everyone is sure that during training everyone should be focused on training, but you feel your heart and breathing tighten. But there is one secret from me when you do the exercise, put a photo next to what sympathizes or emotion in you, maybe this photo of your beloved girl can be a beautiful view of nature, at your discretion, and you yourself won’t notice how you will do more repetitions because you look at a photo or video and your brain is distracted, it’s as if it’s turned off and you almost don’t feel tired, just a slight burning sensation in your muscles. 60. Life is not a uniformly lit road. 61. At the beginning of life, you smile with fear. In the middle and at the end, you smile and laugh with hatred. 62. Thinking is just glass showing the world around or the inside, but among fools it is tightly tinted. 63. Blood must be constantly driven from the brain (reading) to the muscles (bodybuilding) from there to the penis (sex and practice penis enlargement). Blood increases the volume of all three of these sections of the body. Blood stores experience, information that goes into the soul, into genes, blood gives strength to posterity, all this will come in handy in the next life. Blood makes it possible to become stronger and more your own problems and then your problems will be afraid of you. 64. Just an idea: A motivating lesson. All schools and universities need a motivating lesson. In which psychologists will motivate learning to show, explain what will happen to them if they do not study, show today's vacancies and opportunities, universities and organizations. You need to work with teenagers and students and they will understand who to become. 66. Regression is a speedometer of stupidity, the speed of which is just off the charts in developed countries. In them regress mixed up progress. 67. Love is when you have lived your whole life with your man. You find after death in paradise or in hell and spend eternity with this person, with this person eternity as a happy moment. 68. Love is when you give up your own egoism and take that very person into your life and you understand that you are not alone in the whole universe. 69. Opinion, theory and hypothesis - it's like a water attraction surfing, how long you stay on the board is only a matter of time, and when you fall you will be replaced by another surfer. 71. All fictional characters, mascots of sports teams, animators in costumes of famous characters, cosplay, they all fight for you, for your love, like hummingbirds hover around your head, they want to take the essence of life from you. All of them distract from life itself. 72. Orgasms of love. The first orgasm because of lust, the second orgasm because of love, the third because of passion. 73. Success in bodybuilding is not a show off, but a competent distribution of strength and energy. Constantly make friends at a gas station of motivation, on fuel of desire. 74. Learn to love Parrots, dogs, cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, they are all great simulators of tenderness, they teach kindness and love. Train, learn from them to be gentle and sweet, sensitive, caring, faithful, all this will help you in your relationship with the opposite sex. Give your soulmate as often as possible affectionate, kiss, hug, love soul and heart, and only then genitals. 75. Love is like a wind tunnel where in a personal intimate space, from feelings you soar above the ground. 76. Unfortunately, relationships like karting, it is important for people not to act together, leadership is important here. 77. Understanding as a gas burner, combines any character. 79. Truth is devoid of temptation. 80. Your love is a gift from God for humanity. If your love is stronger than all the dark feelings on earth, then you are much stronger than more than one billion people. 81. A woman is a veil of mystery, a screen of temptation, an unfinished, unsolved love detective. All this leads to an uncharted, but infinitely new, helps to uncover in yourself what I had not previously suspected. 82. A smile of awareness A man between anger and despondency, illuminates both sides with selfless nobility. A thought emerges from the depths, or goes into the depths, into dreams, into unconsciousness, where there are only fears, desires, and memories. The head is connected with the other world, the pillar of the beam around which thoughts move, your mind opens thousands of dimensions into alternative dimensions of the imagination. A smile will reveal the true self, a smile will open the bridge to it. A crazy smile stretches to the floor, it is like a cell of the soul, the edges of the lips are connected with portals to the other world, they are also smiles twisted into spirals, gas of laughter comes out through the teeth, in the smile a whole universe of awareness, a smile digging into other smiles, connecting them together and stretching them out. Other smiling personalities burst from the face while in a special state of mind. In the head, the third eye of the suspects of all traitors squinted, electric wires connected to the head connected with reality, with its whisper. In a giant smile opening up to the world, a smiling powerful force lurks smiling eyes of the bright side of the person. The body and soul are torn and there are crazy smiles too, the body opens, and there is a portal to the wonderful world. A smile sometimes coils into a spiral of thoughts, leaving a person in himself, tearing themselves away from external values, plunging into spirituality, and then spinning around him, immersing himself in his own self. Part of the body is a cloak in which other forms of mood are hidden. The body has ten smiling sneak tails sent by the dark side of the person. There is a wired smile in the body that wants to say a lot, it is in the back of the head and there is a bag that accumulates laughter and absorbs someone else's.

The Academy has the horrible taste to have a star, choking with emotion, present this deathbed award so that there can be no doubt in anybody's mind why the award is so hurriedly given.

"1. Plush greed There are so many mechanical hypocritical toys (people) in this two-faced world of hypocritical egoism. They are cute and obedient from the outside, programmed to serve, but at the same time completely soulless from the inside. 2. Order and chaos Order is a blank canvas, and chaos is the bright colors of despair. They depict suffering, unless of course suffering can be called beautiful knowledge that gives the catharsis of awareness from experience. 3. Nature leads us to death. Nature is a great manager with an organizer of instincts in his hands, where all human vices and internal shortcomings are. It controls the cyclical nature of the universal calendar leading us to death, the same thing happened with previous races living on our earth. Evolution leading to a logical conclusion from our madness and despair, to the decline of mankind. But nature cannot destroy a civilization that has abandoned the great self-deception of egoism, which will be the main cause of human death. Only that race that will abandon its own egoism will absorb the humanism of selfless nobleness where literally every life will be appreciated, can deceive nature itself and experience the new dawn of awareness, namely immortality in eternity. It must be understood that death is the best helper of nature; it is just a gardener who does not allow the Garden of Eden to overgrow. But thanks to the unity of mankind, we also know other gardens in other worlds. 4. Humor is a very funny depression, bright, colorful pessimism. 5. Fear is the younger brother of death. Fear is constantly trying to surpass his older brother. 7. Good and love is an interdimensional multidimensional spatial form of philosophy outside of time; it is a state of harmony in eternity, the key to all worlds and inner worlds of people, both external and hidden. With this vision of thinking, you see everything at once, simultaneously deeply and from above, you see all the forms of time in one palm. 8. Lips and tongue are three drills. A smile from a drill grinds any evil face. 9. Techno world Any madness can be called progress. Meat, blood and bones are mixed with high technology, the spirit of humanity will dissolve in cold metal. The imagination of people is becoming more and more terrible, bodymodification shows our ugly entities turned inside out, good with evil, how difficult the interweaving of DNA from which people slowly and painfully go crazy, self-destruction is only an indifference to eternity that destroys this complex chain. The ranks of restless souls wandering the earth will replenish. Choose the side of goodness and light, selfless nobleness, true love and sincere friendship and you will thank yourself for all eternity, only conscience will lead you to paradise. 10. Love outside the dimension Love is peace and tenderness of the light of souls, the unity of tenderness. From love you fall into a gap in space and time, love outside the dimension is a very special space for two lovers in ordinary reality. 11. Time is chess. Time and space is a chessboard, here pawns are your enemies, more important pieces are your internal flaws and vices. There are millions of options for the moves of your will that show completely different forms of the future. Remember that each of your moves reflects your form of the future in life, but also after death. Make your fate check and checkmate. 12. Pseudo-science All of these politicized pseudo-theories and hypotheses, pseudo-facts that brazenly lie, starting their speech with the words: few people know. They turn science into an absurdity, and they thereby erase your memory in this confusion, constantly correcting it, they rob you of the past, plunging it into a false future. 13. On the body of pessimism, the sound dynamics of truth are everywhere. 14. Take care of children. Children are eggs on their backs that hatch and fall to the ground only twenty years later. An adult comes out of an egg and becomes a new parent. 15. A person who has the will, holds in his hands a cosmo-blaster similar to a bazooka, which is directly connected to his back, is charged with the strength of the charge of spirit. He shoots an energy ray, which is charged by his strength of mind. Your fortitude is your weapon against a destructive enemy named laziness. 16. Man is a portal. Man is a portal to another world, the inner world of a person. He doesn’t let everyone in it and sometimes releases his ideas into the outside world. The heart, mind and soul are portals to the inner world. 17. Be a living embodiment of optimism that holds in your hands a laser blaster that is directly connected to his body, charges the weapon with optimism and shoots sad people with a charge of fun and joy. Sometimes it explodes like thermonuclear optimism, spreading a wave of positive throughout the city, and self-restores in a few seconds. 18. Seven mirrors on an asteroid. Seven broken mirrors on an asteroid that moves around the sun. A piece of land of a forgotten civilization. In these mirrors there were seven alternative human and alien worlds, having passed through all the worlds you are farther and farther away from reality. But reality is what the universe itself created, it is something that was not artificially created for the benefit of empty illusions. If the world is full of illusions, then the mirror reflects these illusions. The real world shines like sunlight through all these mirrors. 19. Atrocious cinema We see how on television some animals kill others, and the cameraman filming this atrocity believes that it is impossible to interfere in the affairs of nature. We see people being killed in movies or on television, we sympathize, and then we don't care. Aliens and gods watch how every day they kill people and animals and plants and they, like that cameraman, think that they should not interfere in their affairs, they like watching a movie, at first they sympathize, and then they don’t care. 20. A smile of cynicism Voiced by schizoid music coming from broken toys. He crawled out of a big, stuffed toy, he personified cynicism, he was a toy of society, his pumping, sociopathic, arrogant smile of cynicism. Indifferently looking at the tears of the suffering. A smile infectiously pulls evil smiles on everyone, thereby people make each other worse, worse and worse. A smile of a cynic, in his hands are the deadly, comical trump cards of deceit. 21. Heroes among traitors Sometimes a snow globe, that is, our world, shakes and shakes. This is a periodic end of the world, or simply war. This is only necessary in order to see among the chaos of true heroes among traitors. 22. Sometimes opinion turns into a sect. Opinion is selfish and rarely has any connection with the truth. Opinion is a branded mask of personality, a source of opinion that is worn by thousands and thousands of naive individuals, symbolically turning into itself. A selfish opinion hides in a hypothesis, gaining an army of supporters, authority turns a hypothesis into a theory, and time turns a theory into a pseudo fact. Sometimes opinion turns into a sect, gaining an army of adept marketers, plunging society into an even worse form of delusion and confusion. While truth has no form of selfishness, it thinks of everyone, it is a source of good and light. Humanity will die due to selfish opinions serving only for elite units. 23. The Internet spoils eyesight and the brain. The time spent on the Internet and computer games is an empty spent vision that is useful in old age. Better to read books, they do not destroy vision and give deep knowledge, it is knowledge that distinguishes us from animals. Instead of mania stupidity of the Internet, you will have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. This is better than the Internet. I hope you understand this until your vision has finally deteriorated into a blank. One of the highest values ​​is awareness from knowledge, if you have learned a lot from the knowledge you have gained from life or books, then you have lived your life for good reason. 24. The keys to the higher worlds The knowledge of world religions is just four keys to a higher form of awareness, they will open the gates to the higher worlds, you just need to choose one of these keys to evolve. 25. Lyrical aesthetics In reality, all people are beautiful in appearance and there are no ugly people at all, since this is a vital, lyrical aesthetics of appearance, which has a special coloring of romance, it is beautiful because it is true, without any illusions, it is a form of aesthetics from which people wean because of technocratization of society. 26. The smile of the insight The smile of awareness, its edges pierce the fabric of reality and reveal what is hidden from view, the black humor of reality devoid of all hypocrisy. 27. The truth about man. Man is very beautiful only under a certain coverage of the truth and situation in life. 28. Refers to the whole of humanity, people will become people only when they give up their own egoism. Only then will we cease to be part of the animal world, and will evolve into representatives of a higher race. 29. People are like meteorites that leave scars of selfishness on a common planet earth. 30. Forgiving is much more profitable than taking revenge. Clinical death is a rebirth of the mind only for units, either a hero or a bastard returns from hell. If you want a spoiler, hell does not change people there, the environment is not suitable for changes for the better. And here is the information from your dreams, the villains of your life are those who you didn’t like in your past life, you can fight many lives with them and you don’t suspect about it, and God only expects a truce from both of you, and the lesson in life is not to pay attention and forgive the bastards, let them into paradise, and then in the next life they will become friends or will not touch at all. And if you do not forgive, they will return from hell even more evil and will again spoil your life. So goodbye and do not pay attention, for the sake of your own psyche. 31. Fate controls a person using a game joystick. 32. Fear is meaningless. Fear is like falling into the tunnel of inevitability, it is excitement and the nervous laugh of fearlessness, excitement until the heart stops. Having known the bottom of the abyss, you understand that there is nothing to fear during a sinful life, because everything is like in a dream of the illusions of materialism, everything is temporary. They are only afraid of what will happen after death, because everything is eternal there and everything is real. 33. Fate is a fictional alter of the ego of humanity Despondency, voiced by depressive jazz, which has slightly schizoid melodies, vile moments of life. It’s like an almost smoked cigarette that you crush with a shoe, almost completely smoked psyche, an almost drunk soul with the greedily lustful hedonism of this world, a lonely soul in the midst of hypocritical selfishness. You see neon signs of morally decaying cities illuminating the darkness of egoism, they are like guiding threads of lascivious lost souls in which conscience has rotted and only despair remains. Here, people often cheat on each other at heart; they are just sex toys of lust. Here, madness becomes harmlessly the norm. They do not understand that the second name of death is saving, all that death offers is to save literally on everything. Here every year they wait for the end of the world, it seems to them that fate has pointed a gun at mankind, and wonders if there is a bullet there or not, but mankind is crazy, in fact, it has aimed a gun at itself, and fate is a fictional alter ego. 34. Because love is higher than sex. The more you love a girl, the less you want sex with her. You only want to hug your soul, love with your heart and kiss her lips and cheeks. Because love is higher than sex. 35. Nobleness is always the right answer in difficult life tests. 36. Nature has launched a mechanism for the destruction of humanity 38. Love is a heart shining with sunlight, in the shape of a golden gem like a big diamond for the whole hand, in the shape of a heart drops of genuine love dripping from it that can breathe life into any life form. 39. Faith is oxygen. Faith is invulnerability; it is nourished by stubbornness, motivation itself and an endless stream of will. His body is mortal, but the spirit of faith cannot be killed. Faith is the oxygen that feeds the brain, helping it think sensibly. 40. True love is a special invisible thread consisting of common bright memories, because it is pleasant memories that strengthen this thread of love, which intensifies over the years. No knives and axes of conflict, resentment or guilt can destroy it, because your love is much more valuable than all this unnecessary garbage. This thread grows, becomes stronger and stronger, turns two people into one full-fledged person. 41. Spirit of love. When love dies, it is as if a person has died, spirit comes out of his body, this spirit is memory, boredom, memory. This is a life of love after parting, as if life after death. This spirit wanders in your mind, soul and heart. 42. Love is the highest form of thinking in the universe. Love is the highest form of thinking in the universe. It is higher than any form of appearance and character, higher than money, higher than Nazism racism, higher sexism and feminism, higher and more valuable than any problems, higher than any insults and guilt, above all earthly, material values. Love is the thinking and life of the spirit, not the body, in any world, dimension, universe, timeless. Since the spirit is directly connected with the heart, this constitutes the true shape of the body, thereby you see much more and deeper than the animal vision of the materialist, atheist. Love is when you sacrifice your ideals, dreams for the sake of your loved one because you value and love this person much more than anything in the world, because your soulmate and your children are your highest value in the universe. 43. The smile of the hypocrite is a half-face mask from a broken mirror which reflects tens of hundreds of false smiles of him and those who stand and stood in front of him. 44. Ego orgasm. Complimenting a girl is like you masturbating her vagina in various ways, bringing to an ego an orgasm of love. The more orgasms the deeper you penetrate her bosom of love. 46. ​​The ghosts of the present Sometimes, any of us feels like a ghost, you seem to be among people, but almost no one notices you, you are among a crowd of people and you are as if dead to them, as if in a paranormal video about ghosts. You are alone and you seem to merge together with reality, gradually disappearing into it. 47. A hypocrite does not have a face at all. He wears thousands of sneaky masks, because he has many connections and acquaintances, but he has no true friends, he has no personality, no character, only charisma and acting, he can be anyone and anything, but he completely forgot his true self. 48. What mankind does to itself is suicidal cannibalism. 49. Revenge is meaningless and unprofitable If some person really shit in your psyche and soul very well and considers himself right. So think very well whether it is because of him or her that you spoil your karma, because God is looking at you, think very well he has already spoiled his karma and now non-verbally encourages you to spoil your karma, thereby you give him comfort that you are no better than him . After all, in your next life you will live worse because of your revenge and again you will see him or her and everything will start again. Just don't answer him or her, get out of the karmic circle of revenge. 50. If you see clearly, you are already a light bulb; you illuminate the darkness of ignorance. Light bulbs include where there is no light of science, philosophy and culture. But this light is artificial, because it is completely composed of theories, there are almost no facts in it. Light for the blind who still do not understand anything. 51. Time is just a record. If there is a concept of future time, then we live in the past, there is no concept of present time, there is only our current time for us. Imagine that the time periods of the past, present, and future as cassette disks of a tape recorder of the 20th century, we are imprisoned in a time loop from which we physically can not get out as we age. Your life is a tape recording of audio or video as you like, there is no fate, everything is decided by the higher forces that work on the time script. 52. Intelligence is an open path to hundreds, thousands of different dimensions - these are variations of thinking. 53. Selfish minds in cells. Cells in your smiles and eyes. 54. People strive for anarchy in their own psyche, they go to the mind of a spoiled child, who supposedly can do anything, when people come to this they will be extremely vulnerable and will see a high mortality rate. 55. Cities of the future under a dome, they are isolated from reality, they breathe the illusions of egoism. 56. A man looks like a knife, one side strokes, while the other side of the personality, ha ha ha, you understand. Man is a brilliant psychological, mental weapon that must be in the hands of good against the forces of evil. 57. A man is a llama who bears the burdens of life, while his wife owns a llama. and drags him to the top of the mountain of success. 58. A lazy person looks so much like a square ball. 59. How to trick your brain Advice for bodybuilders, everyone is sure that during training everyone should be focused on training, but you feel your heart and breathing tighten. But there is one secret from me when you do the exercise, put a photo next to what sympathizes or emotion in you, maybe this photo of your beloved girl can be a beautiful view of nature, at your discretion, and you yourself won’t notice how you will do more repetitions because you look at a photo or video and your brain is distracted, it’s as if it’s turned off and you almost don’t feel tired, just a slight burning sensation in your muscles. 60. Life is not a uniformly lit road. 61. At the beginning of life, you smile with fear. In the middle and at the end, you smile and laugh with hatred. 62. Thinking is just glass showing the world around or the inside, but among fools it is tightly tinted. 63. Blood must be constantly driven from the brain (reading) to the muscles (bodybuilding) from there to the penis (sex and practice penis enlargement). Blood increases the volume of all three of these sections of the body. Blood stores experience, information that goes into the soul, into genes, blood gives strength to posterity, all this will come in handy in the next life. Blood makes it possible to become stronger and more your own problems and then your problems will be afraid of you. 64. Just an idea: A motivating lesson. All schools and universities need a motivating lesson. In which psychologists will motivate learning to show, explain what will happen to them if they do not study, show today's vacancies and opportunities, universities and organizations. You need to work with teenagers and students and they will understand who to become. 66. Regression is a speedometer of stupidity, the speed of which is just off the charts in developed countries. In them regress mixed up progress. 67. Love is when you have lived your whole life with your man. You find after death in paradise or in hell and spend eternity with this person, with this person eternity as a happy moment. 68. Love is when you give up your own egoism and take that very person into your life and you understand that you are not alone in the whole universe. 69. Opinion, theory and hypothesis - it's like a water attraction surfing, how long you stay on the board is only a matter of time, and when you fall you will be replaced by another surfer. 71. All fictional characters, mascots of sports teams, animators in costumes of famous characters, cosplay, they all fight for you, for your love, like hummingbirds hover around your head, they want to take the essence of life from you. All of them distract from life itself. 72. Orgasms of love. The first orgasm because of lust, the second orgasm because of love, the third because of passion. 73. Success in bodybuilding is not a show off, but a competent distribution of strength and energy. Constantly make friends at a gas station of motivation, on fuel of desire. 74. Learn to love Parrots, dogs, cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, they are all great simulators of tenderness, they teach kindness and love. Train, learn from them to be gentle and sweet, sensitive, caring, faithful, all this will help you in your relationship with the opposite sex. Give your soulmate as often as possible affectionate, kiss, hug, love soul and heart, and only then genitals. 75. Love is like a wind tunnel where in a personal intimate space, from feelings you soar above the ground. 76. Unfortunately, relationships like karting, it is important for people not to act together, leadership is important here. 77. Understanding as a gas burner, combines any character. 79. Truth is devoid of temptation. 80. Your love is a gift from God for humanity. If your love is stronger than all the dark feelings on earth, then you are much stronger than more than one billion people. 81. A woman is a veil of mystery, a screen of temptation, an unfinished, unsolved love detective. All this leads to an uncharted, but infinitely new, helps to uncover in yourself what I had not previously suspected. 82. A smile of awareness A man between anger and despondency, illuminates both sides with selfless nobility. A thought emerges from the depths, or goes into the depths, into dreams, into unconsciousness, where there are only fears, desires, and memories. The head is connected with the other world, the pillar of the beam around which thoughts move, your mind opens thousands of dimensions into alternative dimensions of the imagination. A smile will reveal the true self, a smile will open the bridge to it. A crazy smile stretches to the floor, it is like a cell of the soul, the edges of the lips are connected with portals to the other world, they are also smiles twisted into spirals, gas of laughter comes out through the teeth, in the smile a whole universe of awareness, a smile digging into other smiles, connecting them together and stretching them out. Other smiling personalities burst from the face while in a special state of mind. In the head, the third eye of the suspects of all traitors squinted, electric wires connected to the head connected with reality, with its whisper. In a giant smile opening up to the world, a smiling powerful force lurks smiling eyes of the bright side of the person. The body and soul are torn and there are crazy smiles too, the body opens, and there is a portal to the wonderful world. A smile sometimes coils into a spiral of thoughts, leaving a person in himself, tearing themselves away from external values, plunging into spirituality, and then spinning around him, immersing himself in his own self. Part of the body is a cloak in which other forms of mood are hidden. The body has ten smiling sneak tails sent by the dark side of the person. There is a wired smile in the body that wants to say a lot, it is in the back of the head and there is a bag that accumulates laughter and absorbs someone else's.

"1. Reality is an infernal black comedy of truth, ironic black humor of a scenario of life, where justice is just sarcasm. 2. Thoughts are lightning, the mystical fire of the universe. 3. Science plays the board game Doctor, they know that the human body is the main key to the secrets of the universe and existence itself, but immortality will give the most important secret of life, and it will tell you that over time a person does not value anything, he is just a spectator and a consumer with popcorn, which symbolizes values, for a pessimist it is salty, for an optimist, sweet caramel hedonism. 5. The game of caps of values ​​of intergenerational generations is a war of illusion. 6. Fantasy as endless facets of imagination Geek dice for board games, imagination is an attempt to know oneself and at the same time a great denial of true reality. Imagination is a fog of illusion drugs. 7. Consciousness is a starship in an infinite space of thoughts, a multi-dimensional universe of various levels of awareness. 8. Body modification and plastic surgery, etc., this is an escape from the true self, from its essence from its own perfection given by God. This immersion in the endless illusions of the ego, pride and vanity is a parody of your self, you paint your portrait from the lower feelings. 9. Pride, ego, vanity are all fear, a thirst to materialize in history, in a world where everything is forgotten - this is the only thing that connects you with the tiny world of people, abandoning them you will know the infinity of the universe. 10. Love, selfless nobility and forgiveness are the immortality of humanity. Higher awareness is the highest dimension of love. Author: Musin Almat Zhumabekovich",games
